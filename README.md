## How It's Made:

The front-end for this app was built using React and Tailwindcss, React-router-dom, and DaisyUi (a Tailwindcss component library).

### Tech used:

**HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI**

## Optimizations

As I build more and more projects I will continue to optimize this template in order to have a clean starting point for future projects.

## Lessons Learned:

I have learned how easy a simple website can be made by using a combination of React components and TailwindCSS. As a bonus DaisyUI gives TailwindCSS components as well.
